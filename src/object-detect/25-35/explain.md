- Param1: It is the threshold of the Canny edge detector output. Canny edge detection is usually performed before Hough transform to obtain edge information in the image. param1 sets the Canny high threshold, and the low threshold is automatically set to half of the high threshold. The larger the param1 value, the fewer edges are detected, thus reducing noise interference, but some real edges may be missed.

- Param2: It is the accumulator threshold of the Hough transform. In Hough space, each intersection represents a possible straight line. param2 sets the minimum number of votes (accumulator value) required to detect a straight line. The larger the param2 value, the fewer straight lines are detected, which means that only straight lines that receive enough votes will be identified, thus reducing false detections; conversely, the smaller the param2 value, the more straight lines can be detected, including some false straight lines generated by noise or other non-straight line features.

- **In another word**: param1 & 2 both describe the sensitiveness of the algorithm. Param1 is the "tolerance of noise", and param2 is the "tolerance of false positive" or "expect of accuracy".

- For this test, the best params are { param1: 78, param2: 22, min-radius: 342, max-radius: 411 }
